# Student-Grade-Sorter
## Description
This project implements the QuickSort algorithm in Python to sort a list of student names and their corresponding marks in descending order.

## Aim
To efficiently sort student data using the QuickSort algorithm, enhancing data organization and analysis of student performance.

## Objectives
- Implement QuickSort to sort student names and marks.
- Improve organization of student performance data.
- Demonstrate the efficiency of the QuickSort algorithm.
- Create an educational tool for understanding sorting algorithms.

## How It Works
1. The quicksort function sorts the student data.
2. A pivot is selected to partition the data.
3. The list is recursively sorted based on the pivot.
4. The sorted results are combined and returned.
